# loopback-example-connector.soap

Hacked from examples at Strongloop github

### Example 1 - from Strongloop github (works)

To expose REST APIs to proxy the SOAP web services, run:

```
node weather-rest
```

then browse to [http://localhost:3000/explorer](http://localhost:3000/explorer)

### Example 2 - simple Java SOAP server access (semi-works)

To expose REST APIs to proxy the SOAP web services, run:

```
node hello-rest
```

then browse to [http://localhost:3000/explorer](http://localhost:3000/explorer)

### Example 3 - access internal VA/VOA SOAP endpoint (doesn't work)

To expose REST APIs to proxy the SOAP web services, run:

```
node voa-rest
```

then browse to [http://localhost:3000/explorer](http://localhost:3000/explorer)
